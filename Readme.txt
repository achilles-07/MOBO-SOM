This is the matlab code for multi-objective bonobo optimizer (MOBO). Here, three versions of MOBO were developed, 
such as MOBO with grid-index approach (MOBO1), MOBO with non-dominated sorting and crowding distance approach (MOBO2) and MOBO with decomposition technique (MOBO3).
Among these three versions, MOBO2 approach was found to have better performances compared to other two approaches, in general.
This is written for solving unconstrained optimization problems. 
However, it can also solve constrained optimization problems with penalty function approaches.

User should write his/her own objective function and modify accordingly.

Modify the common parameters and algorithm-specific parameters as per the needs of the problem.
